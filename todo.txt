Warnings in modpack:
- Still in Beta. Only report issues to modders if their mods have been tested isolated. Otherwise send bug reports towards me (ideally with the filter disabled)

- Biased look and feel. The most affecting changes (like outlines, fresh animations, the new redstone look or legacy copper textures) can be all disabled under Options -> Resource Packs.
- Arachnophobia warning: The Fresh Extras Resource Pack contains spiders that might trigger arachnophobia in some players. For these, disabling that resource pack is recommended.
